## MakeChange

### Intro
This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked for an item amount.
The user then enters the amount. Then the user is asked for an amount tendered,
 enters the amount, and is given change in the largest denominations possible.
 The amount of dollar and coin types are calculated using the modulus operator.
 By starting starting from the highest increment of hundred dollar bills we can use the modulus to see if there is a remainder for the next closest increment and continue down the respectable dollar amount.  The same formula is used for determining the amount of coins that are require to make the proper amount of change starting from the highest increments. Then the if and else if statements are used to print out the amount of dollars and change and whether to determine if it is singular or plural.

This project was assigned after Week 1 of Skill Distillery's Java Coding School.
